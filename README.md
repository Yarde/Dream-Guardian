## Description
Today you will become a caring father to your beautiful little girl. She told you, crying out loud, there are monsters in her room, and she has nightmares. Of course, everybody knows how children's imagination works - they will find danger in a pile of dirty clothes. But is it just kids' imagination this time? She trusts you, and you must protect her precious dreams from anything that happens.

The game begins with an aerial look of a kids' room. It is pretty dark and quiet. However, something seems to be off. You better check if the windows are locked, be sure that the wardrobe won't open, and tuck her in to ensure that your precious daughter will be sleeping like a rock. All checked up? You are confident that she is safe and sound, but wait? Why did this lamp suddenly switch on? And what is going on with this wind? You just checked the windows, and they were seamed. Your baby is becoming more and more aware of what is going on and is slowly regaining consciousness. Do not let them wake her up! Watch out! Something creepy is reaching out for her blanket! How long can you keep her safe? Will you protect her until the morning, or will you let her down?
